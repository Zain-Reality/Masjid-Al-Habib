                 <h2> Prayers</h2>
                 <p>
                    The Mosque is open every day of the year for people to use our prayer facilities,
                    including all five daily prayers, and the special prayers for Ramadan and Eid.
                    The prayer halls are accessible from 10am, and close about half an hour after the last prayer of the day, ‘Isha. 
                    The main prayer hall is also open for Fajr, the morning prayer.
                 </p>

                 <h2>Congregational prayers</h2>
                 <p>  We hold congregational prayers at specific times,
                      which you can find in our prayer timetable. 
                      There’s a more detailed explanation of our prayer times here. 
                      These prayers typically take 10–15 minutes.
                    
                    For Fajr, we open the main prayer hall half an hour before the time set for the congregational prayer, 
                    and close again about 15 minutes after the prayer finishes.
                    On Fridays, the special Jumuah prayer (which replaces the Zuhr prayer) is preceded by a sermon (khutbah),
                    which takes about half an hour. From late March to late October (in the days of British Summer Time) the sermon starts at about 1:15pm; for the rest of the year it is about 12:30pm.
                 </p>

                 <h2> Facilities</h2>
                 <p>
                    There are separate prayer facilities for men and women: men pray in the ground floor hall, and women in the second floor hall.
                    All areas are served by modern ablutions facilities, which include showers.
                 </p>
                 
                 <h2> Arabic classes</h2>
                <p>On a weekly basis at the Masjid, classes are hosted by teachers who have had plenty of experience in gathering knowledge throughout their lives regarding the Deen (faith), and we believe it is essential to spread that knowledge, to be able to teach the youth the true meaning of life. We are a religion of peace, we do not wish to harm or bother any person or cause distress to any being. So we teach people what it means to have good morals, what it means to be able to live in peace and harmony with all people and what it means to have basic etiquette.

                    Our classes have a wide range of topics, through being able to recite the holy Quran and to be able to understand it, and extract any of its valuable lessons and relate it to the ordeals we face throughout our whole lives, a good example being the story of Yusuf (Alayhi-Salaam) also known as Joseph. When he was abandoned by his brothers and was left to die, that was the beginning of his trial, separated from his father. Yusuf did not die and was taken in as a slave by people who worked for the king. After he was thrown into prison unjustly, being framed for something he didn’t do. And in his solitude and loneliness for many years he still remembered Allah and remained patient, and through his patience and belief in God being the greatest helper. Yusuf later became free, because of his ability given by God to interpret dreams, being a massive help; he used this to become of assistance to the king when most needed, battling the upcoming drought at the time and was spared because he saved the entire kingdom. Soon after Yusuf rose and became the very ruler of Egypt through his hard work and honesty. Meanwhile his hungry brothers were wondering around desperately for food, not caring whether Yusuf was alive or not. They came across a very fair ruler whom fed them until they forgot about their starvation and worries, they then bowed their heads down out of respect when they realised it was Yusuf  the same brother they initially betrayed and left to die in the middle of nowhere out of their jealousy.
