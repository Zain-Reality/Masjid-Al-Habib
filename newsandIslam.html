         <h3>The five pillars of Islam</h3>
         <p> The most important Muslim practices are the Five Pillars of Islam.

            The Five Pillars of Islam are the five obligations that every Muslim must satisfy in order to live a good and responsible life according to Islam.
            
            The Five Pillars consist of:
            
           
•	Shahada (Profession of faith) firmly believing there is no God but Allah, and that Muhammad peace be upon him was the final messenger.
•	Salah (Prayer) performing the same prayer prescribed to Muhammad (pbuh) five times a day during specific times, Fajr being the morning prayer, Zuhr being midday, Asr being late afternoon, Maghrib when the sun sets down, anf finally Isha when the horizon is completely dark. 
•	Zakat (Alms/Charity) 2.5% of one’s wealth being given yearly for the sake of God, relieving any difficulties poor people may be facing throughout the world. This becomes obligatory when one receives money from working.
•	Sawm (Fasting) during the holy month of Ramadan.
•	Hajj (Pilgrimage) a holy experience said to completely clear someone’s past sins if they perform it with pure intentions and sincerity.
